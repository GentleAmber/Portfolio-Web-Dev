# Introduction Of The Projects
This repository includes my personal projects as a portfolio for web development. The following paragraphs will explain **what they are** and **how to run** them respectively.
## 1 Blog Application
It is the first website I have made. User can post new blogs, and edit or delete existing blogs. Note the data is stored in the server, so when the server restarts, user will lose data. Also the preview panel only displays the latest 4 blogs (though all blogs are stored).
<br>
To run the project, direct to `.../1 Blog Application`, run `npm i` in the terminal. After all packages are installed, run `node index.js`, and enter `localhost:3000` in your browser, now you can test the website.

## 2 Use Public API
This website has a home page where a random piece of art is displayed, and a search page where user can search for artworks under certain criteria.
<br>
This website uses this public API: [The Metropolitan Museum of Art Collection API](https://metmuseum.github.io/)
<br>
To run the project, direct to `.../2 Use Public API`, still run `npm i` in the terminal. After all packages are installed, run `node index.js`, and enter `localhost:3000` in your browser.
