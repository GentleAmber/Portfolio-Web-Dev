        <p>
          I enjoy studying about computer. For example, 
          I have been curious about <span class="text-highlight">how computer works</span>
           since I worked at a game company.
          And this game called Turing Complete really helped me understand. I have learnt 
          how single electronic components form into complex ones, how machine codes take effect, and how 
          to programme with assembly language to achieve small functions in this game. It 
          was a wonderful journey.

          After getting to know about SQL injection while learning database on the Java course, I have also been interested 
          in the <span class="text-highlight"> cyber security field.</span> Hacking is the art of rule manipulation.
          I plan to explore this field in the future after building a firm foundation of the basic concepts.

          In my work <a href="./works.html#book-note" target="_blank" class="link">Book Notes</a>, to identify users, instead of using mature package,
          I practiced generating temporary, random tokens and sending them through cookies to better grasp the security-related knowledge.

          Though being a necessity instead of interest to many people in the world, I like <span class="text-highlight">learning English</span> as well. With my mother being
          an earnest English teacher, I started learning English at an early age and have always been 
          excited to explore more. Having got a 7.5 in IELTS exam in 2020, I have been keeping enlarging my vocabulary
          size as well as listening to and speaking more.

      <h2>Games</h2>
      <div class="interest" id="interest-game">
        <p>
          I have played lots of games. My personal top 3 are: 
          <br />
          <span class="text-highlight">- Disco Elysium</span><br />
          <span class="text-highlight">- Metal Gear Solid V: The Phantom Pain</span><br />
          <span class="text-highlight">- Divinity: Original Sin 2</span><br />
          <br />
          Basically, I love games either with good narratives or where I can explore freely and mess around. DE is the representative of 
          100/100 narrative in my opinion, DOS2 has 100/100 gameplay, and MGSV has a perfect mix of the two aspects.
        </p>

          <img src="./images/interest-DOS2.jpg" alt="Poster of Divinity: Original Sin 2"/>

      <h2>Exercises</h2>
      <div class="interest">
        <p>
          I used to work out a lot and can still do a few push-ups at once. Earlier this year
          I did <span class="text-highlight">bouldering</span> once a week with my group. However,
          due to my wrong posture or my either-sedentary-or-exercising-intensely lifestyle, I developed neck and 
          shoulders pain, so I switched to doing <span class="text-highlight">Pilates</span> later on. 
          So far the pain has been long gone, and I am eager to explore other interesting exercises as well.
